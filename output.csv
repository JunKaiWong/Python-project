Great all metal, quality build. Runs quiet with lower/stable temps while giving me much better performance overall. Warzone 2 1080p w/ ultra settings runs around 165fps, Fortnite running over 225 w/ similar settings, MSFS running roughly 75 fps on high settings (w/ triple monitors via Nvidia Surround), and the list goes on and on. I have it paired w/ an i5-12600k, and if anyone says the CPU will bottleneck this, they're dead wrong. CPU is NOWHERE near any sort of bottleneck and they pair amazingly. If you got the money and are eyeing this card, I strongly recommend."", ""Holy smokes its a big card. I thought I ordered the two fan unit, but this little monster came. It's packaging is very impressive, it comes in a custom box, wrapped very well.Based on the size of this card if I ever run out of weight, I'll just bench press this puppy.Did I mention It's gigantic!! LolMy last build was over 10 years ago, so imagine the leap I just took.I was grimacing a bit over the price, but for a 12gb vid card, let's go!!She is mated to an Asus X570 wifi. I know, I know, should have gotten a better MB, but I was really only planning on doing the MB, mem and HD that failed. Ended up stuffing a 2TB WD SSD, a 2TB platter and some cool corsair memory. Then I decided to get the video card bcoz my old 970 RTX was throwing my board fault beeps. Anyway, just got it up and running. Loving the quickness. Going to load MSFS 2020 and get back to flying to see how she runs. I'm sure it's going to handle it just fine.More later on after I run bench tests. The windows experience score (which yes you still can do on Windows 10) scored me in the high 9's with the exception of the platter even tho she's a 7200rpm gold WD.Oh well I still like it. Win OS on the platter on a 250gb partition, the master boot record of 100mb the rest wide open. The ssd is wide open. Will run the sim off of it.Would definitely recommend it. good luck with your build. See you online in the skies!"", ""Finally, a card thats actually worth a ####! Seriously, this card is a beast! I'm very demanding of my cards. I run 2 monitors one being 1080 and my main a 1440. My most demanding game currently is RDR2. Graphics maxed, AA TAA and this card pumps out well over my frame cap. I'm quite impressed. This card also runs the most cool of all my past cards. Hanging around the 60C mark under high demand. Plus, this card looks super sexy. The dab of RGB adds a nice touch without the overkill. This card also pulls half the wattage than my previous 2060 did! This 4070 does everything I ask it to and I'm glad I got this instead of the TI version and saved 200 bucks. I never would have needed the TI. Good job Asus and Nvidia. 10/10"", 'Kind of unstable, my 2060 never missed a beat, this thing has to reboot each monitor 5 times on startup and occasionally does it once or twice just for fun, and it flickers sometimes. Makes me mad. But it does get FPS, so there is that.', ""The ASUS TUF RTX 4070 OC is an absolute beast that can handle any triple A game with no issues. Despite its size and power, this thing makes almost no noise when running, making my overall build much quieter than I expected. Furthermore, this graphics card opens up the opportunity for me to overclock whenever I feel without any issue.I would definitely recommend this to whoever is looking for a quiet beast of a graphics card. Especially since this is from ASUS. You can almost never go wrong with ASUS graphics cards, that's for sure!"", 'This variant is goated. Full metal build (except for the fans), fits in an ITX case and barely crosses 60c.As for the performance, it even beats Strix 3090 (DLSS 3) while using half the power! (Tested with Cyberpunk 2077 with Pathtracing enabled). It also supports AV1 encoding for those looking to stream high quality streams while using less bandwidth.', ""The build quality is fantastic! Also, this card only needs a single 8-pin power connector, which is great. It's packaged extremely well and comes with it's own GPU stand to prevent sag. The dual BIOS switch is set to quiet right out of the box and indeed, the fans are completely silent on this setting. However, I slid the switch to performance right after trying out the silent operation and I've not heard the fans in this setting either, even after two and three hours of gameplay. This card easily fits in my Corsair 5000d case.My 3070 would get 45fps in MSFS2020 with DLSS set to balanced. I would see 100% GPU usage and 75% CPU. The 3070 would run between 200-230 watts while playing this game and most others. Farcry 6 would see 90 FPS but I couldn't use the HD textures due to only having 8gb of Vram.With this GPU, I've got MSFS2020 set to DLSS with AI Frame Gen enabled. I'm seeing 147fps! I can now land my helicopter on different rooftops in New York city without the 1% lows making for a stuttering landing. The 4070 runs at 80% utilization, CPU down to 50%. I see 155-165W power draw. Farcry 6 now runs in the 130 fps range with HD textures enabled.I didn't need to upgrade my power supply for this GPU as it uses less energy than the 3070 it replaced. So that was a savings. Also, I live in Florida so the 3070 would heat up my office quickly. the lower wattage use translates into less heat put off and a more comfortable room. The extra 4Gb of video Ram is a great upgrade as well.Asus makes some of the very best GPU's on the market and this one in particular has been rated as the best of the 4070 makers by at least two online review sites, and for good reason. Full metal backplate, single 8-pin power connector, silent operation from the three fans and 3080 level performance!"", 'Nvidia has become a criminal enterprise.

I\'m assuming these are mass-tested in open air systems, so the bent tabs wouldn\'t have been noticed; otherwise the only explanation is someone in QC knew it was bent and shipped it anyways.After getting it running, I noticed that the fans make a pretty annoying amount of coil whine.

Boy, I was shocked by its performance for the price. Definitely worth the buy.', ""Very competitively priced item. However the warranty information hasn't stated."", 'Understandably most customer reviews of this ASUS 1060 Dual OC and other graphics cards are written from the viewpoint of gamers and certainly contain a lot of useful benchmarking, as well as how they perform at 1080p resolution. At the same time, periodically you come across an inquiry here and in forums about what is necessary for photo editing. With all due respect, many of the answers are obviously from casual photographers having limited experience with what I would call ""serious"", let alone professional, post-processing. I am not a professional photographer, just a ""serious"" amateur, but while I don\'t profess to have all the answers I thought it might be helpful for others out there if I share my own conclusions.First, some background. I have four builds ""under my belt"". Yes, I know that doesn\'t make me a tech expert either, but still reasonably knowledgeable. For reference, current build is ASUS Z97-Pro ATX mobo, i7 4790K @ 4GHz, 32 GB GSkill F3-1866 RAM, Corsair RM 750 power, two SanDisk Extreme Pro SSD\'s (one 480GB for Win 10x64 and executables, the other 240GB for primary photo storage), and a couple of WD Blue HD for other storage. Current (new) graphics card is this ASUS 1060 6 GB OC, prior card was an EVGA 760 SC with 4GB vram (both purchased from Amazon). Card is mounted in a PCIe 2.0 x 16 slot. A Display Port connection was used with both cards because of the potential for greater color depth compared to HDMI (for now that is limited by Windows and the nVidia driver) and the ability to daisy-chain monitors. The monitor in both cases is an ASUS PA279Q ProArt (IPS, native res 1440p [2640x1440], 99% Adobe RGB, 10 bit color with 14 bit look-up table) calibrated with the Spyder Elite 4 Colorimeter. Video driver is nVidia 372.70 running in 32 bit desktop color depth, 10 bpc output color depth, and full output dynamic range. The only additional OC I have applied is the rather modest ""Game"" boost on ASUS Tweak II (because for my purposes I don\'t need more, probably don\'t even need this boost). Overall not the absolute fastest system, but no slouch either.The photo editing software I use includes Adobe Lightroom CC, Adobe Photoshop CC, version 10.5.1 of On1 Photo 10, and some of the Topaz plug-ins. For now, most of my post-processing editing begins in LR, with side trips to the others. Note: Both the order of editing and experience with the above graphics cards may change once On1 release Photo Raw this fall. Most of my photos are at moderately high res (24 MP), and I typically edit them in 16 bit. Often I will spend one to several hours editing a single photo - with a number of layers and final size up around 40 or 50 MP. (Don\'t laugh: Professionals sometimes spend several days. How long do you gamers spend gaming?) I have edited in both 1080p and 1440p, and prefer the latter for the better resolution (masking, sharpening) and greater screen real estate. So what have I found?Lightroom CC: The LR editing module, like Photoshop (below), is optimized to use a compatible GPU. Open GL 3.3 or higher and 2 GB vram is suggested for high resolution photos [Note: Both of the cards being reviewed meet these requirements]. As long as you stay in LR you are performing non-destructive edits to your Raw file (assuming you started with Raw), and these edits are written to a catalog rather than incorporated into the original file. Perhaps because of this, I have seen little difference in speed between the two GPU\'s when editing with the sliders at either 1080p or 1440p. I do notice some improvement in speed with the 1060 at 1440p (vs the 760) using the graduated and radial filters and the adjustment brush. Thumbnails seem to load more quickly with the 1060 as well.Photoshop CC: Not surprisingly, the PS GPU requirements are similar to LR. But unlike LR, which will automatically use a suitable GPU, in PS you must go to Edit>Preferences>Performance, turn on the ""Use Graphics Processor"" box, and then decide on the Advanced Settings (mine is set to Advanced Drawing with all options selected). When using Adobe Camera Raw, the findings are much the same as with LR. Once you take a Raw file into PS itself, though, you are rendering it into a PSD file - which can take longer to process than a Raw file. When I do go to PS it is mostly to use things that are unavailable elsewhere - like adjustment layers, Content-Aware crop, the Blur Gallery, Gradient Fill, Smart Filters, text layers or Lumenzia (by Greg Benz). According to Adobe, only certain functions are GPU accelerated (see Adobe Support). Nevertheless, there seems to be a definite improvement in responsiveness with the 1060 (in either resolution) when using multiple layers and especially in ""round trips"" via a smart filter to both On1 Photo and Topaz plug-ins. I used to avoid going back and forth from PS to these other programs because it was so sluggish. Based on this, I suspect the GPU accelerated functions like Blur Gallery and Smart Sharpen will also speed up, though I haven\'t tested them yet.On1 Photo 10.5.1: Here there is the most marked difference between a GTX 760 and 1060, probably because this is one of the most graphics intensive photo editors. The program is supposedly able to use ""modern"" GPU\'s (Open GL 2.0 or better) with 256 MB vram and 4 GB system RAM specified (8 GB when used as a PS plug-in). This spec alone makes me wonder if On1 Photo is relying more on the CPU. In Preferences, I have the program set to use 75% of system RAM and 75% of vram, with a 5 GB cache. As with PS, once you take a Raw file into On1 you will be rendering it as a PSD file. On1 Photo is a program I want to love, but as with other reviewers I find there are still bugs in the interface and sluggishness in its performance. In fact, using the GTX 760 at 1440p makes the program very slow indeed. Layered effects (I mostly do not use presets) load slowly and it takes more time than it should to save your work - which you should do frequently because the program has a tendency to crash when you layer up too many effects without saving. And forget using the masking bugs with the 760 at 1440p - they stutter and often freeze up. [These problems are somewhat less, except for the occasional crash, when using the 760 at 1080p.] What about the GTX 1060? Here everything changes! Multiple effects load in the blink of an eye and the masking bugs work as they should, even at 1440p. (I can\'t comment on the program crashes as I haven\'t used this 1060 for very long yet.) All of a sudden it becomes a pleasure to use On1 Photo 10, and that\'s good because this program offers some fantastic and easy to use editing tools for dynamic contrast, tone and color adjustments, stylizing and otherwise ""finishing"" your photo.Note: On1 Inc. will be releasing On1 Photo Raw later this fall. It is a raw processor with no cataloging (vs LR), allowing non-destructive editing and use as a standalone, plug-in for LR and PS, or as a host app. It will be ""tuned for today\'s graphics processors"", with a requirement for Open GL 3.3 with minimum 512 MB vram and 4 GB system RAM (8 GB when used with PS), and is being billed as ""the world\'s fastest . . . raw processor and photo editor available."" I can\'t wait to see how Photo Raw performs with the ASUS 1060 in 1440p resolution!Topaz plug-ins: Topaz Labs has a number of useful photo editing plug-ins for LR and PS, as well as several that do not require a host editor. They recommend at least 4 GB of system RAM and 1 GB of vram (2 GB for optimal performance). GPU requirements vary by product, from Open GL 2.1 to 3.3, and certain products will crash unless these specifications are met. All of the Topaz products I tested ran acceptably with the GTX 760 in 1440p, although the more graphics-intense were a bit slow. Running with the 1060 in 1440p they are noticeably faster and more pleasing to use.Summary: While this is by no means an exhaustive comparison of the GTX 760 vs 1060 for photo editing, it is apparent that resolution is the key factor when it comes to determining your experience. Many photographers and gamers are shifting to larger monitors and 1440p (or higher) resolution. Once you try it (assuming adequate GPU support) you won\'t want to go back. The 760 and 1060 are several generations apart, and since I don\'t purchase a new graphics card every few months I can\'t be certain what is the minimal step up from the 760 for acceptable 1440p performance. I can state with confidence that the ASUS GTX 1060 6 GB Dual OC will do the job. Moreover, at the moment this card is at the ""sweet spot"" when it comes to performance vs price. For benchmarking purposes running Heaven 4.0, my ASUS 1060 in Game Mode at 1440p runs at avg. 71.9 FPS (just saying: I know I\'m not editing videos), with a GPU clock of 1886 and score 1811 at max. temp of 82C with auto fan in a well-ventilated ATX tower. On FurMark 1.18, again in Game Mode, the score was 5280 at avg. 88 FPS and max. temp of 71C using the 1440 preset, 2560x1440 full-screen resolution. The ASUS card seems stable in both tests.Bottom Line: The GTX 1060, 70 and 80 line, with its Pascal architecture, is very attractive to gamers (and I hope I have shown it should be to serious photographers, as well). Since you really don\'t need the speed (or cost) of a 1070 or 1080 for photo editing, the 1060 would seem to be the perfect choice. I have found ASUS products to be well-built and reliable - as noted, I also have an ASUS mobo and monitor. The ASUS 1060 fits nicely in my ATX tower and doesn\'t override two slots as is the case with some other cards. Moreover, the dual fans are quiet and keep temps down. I also appreciate the pair of HDMI and Display Port connectors. The only caveat - Tweak II could use some tweaking. You might prefer MSI Afterburner if you are going to do any serious oc. My Conclusion: Forget the forum advice about $80 graphics cards and so-so CPU\'s for photo editing. Pick up one of these ASUS GTX 1060 cards (preferably the 6 GB version) if you can and if your CPU won\'t be a bottleneck. You won\'t go wrong!', ""Why I bought this card: I needed a card to put in fairly budget rig I was building, and this was one of the cheaper cards available at the time.TL;DR : A very solid card, overclocks nicely, had no temp problems while gaming, fairly quiet. Definitely would recommend.Pros:-Good Cooler for the price-Plug and play, all you need are the Nvidia drivers and the card will work just fine.-GPU Tweak II is easy to use and gives full control over the performance of the card.-Overclock like beast, max OC was 2062 MHz, average OC was 2025 MHz.-2 HDMI ports, good not only for VR, but also for those who do not have any DP capable monitors.-No coil whineCons:-Shroud feels cheap-Fans on the louder side-The presets in the card management utility(GPU Tweak) are lackluster, make your own profiles for best performance.Other thoughts: For the 275$ I paid for this card at the time of purchase I expected some slightly better fans, though the current one get the job done fine.Full Review:Shipping and Packaging: Card shipped very fast, even though amazon predicted that it would take up to two weeks to ship, I got it in three days. The packaging was undamaged and very well done, with foam padding all around the card to prevent damage, though even the outer box in which the card was shipped was undamaged.First Impression:The card had an average weight at this length. The white plastic shroud felt on the cheaper side, though this is to be expected on a 1060 25$ above MSRP. The fans looked and felt like solid, medium quality fans. There is no back plate, but at this price that is the standard.Installation:Nothing out of the ordinary, card went into the pci-e slot with no issues and the 6 pin power connector had no problems going in either.General Use: The card performed very nicely after simply installing the latest drivers from Nvidia, so anyone looking for a plug and play card, you will find this card very satisfactory in that regard. The card will handle games at 1080p like the average GTX 1060, so I won't bother posting the benchmarks, because they are available from many different sources.Different Modes & Overclocking:Initially I was going dock this card a star for being nothing out of the ordinary in all of my tests, that is until I got to use GPU Tweak 2 to overclock the card and play around with the available presets. This card comes with three presets: Silent Mode, Gaming Mode and OC Mode, though you can add your own custom profile. Silent mode does its job well, it keeps the card as silent as possible, though this does prevent the card from getting its max performance to keep the card cooler. I used this for low intensity gaming and movie watching and it was silent throughout my experience. Gaming mode is nothing impressive; it will allow you to handle most modern games at 1080p without a hitch, but the fan profile on this is mediocre and the card will throttle after a few hours of intensive gaming. The OC mode is lackluster; yes it does boost the card to a higher frequency (1999 MHz) than gaming mode(1974 MHz) but it's not by much, and it barely touches the power limit, resulting in frequent stutters in my benchmarks. The fan curve on this is the worst of the three modes, and the card throttled down quite a bit after just 1.5 cycles of Unigine Heaven. Where this card truly excels is in the custom profiles category: I managed to dial in a 2062 MHz overclock on this card, which throttled down to 2025MHz due to the power limit, though 2025Mhz on a 1060 is still nothing to scoff at. Adjusting the fan curve, power limit and voltage was very easy, and to make things easier, the power limit and temp target are coupled, so raising the power limit will automatically raise the temp target for you ass well. though at high rpm, these fans are very noisy, but not the loudest ones I've heard on a graphics card before. On a final note for this section, even though it seems I'm ripping this card a new one, its more me complaining about he quality of presets for this card. The card is advertised with a Boost Clock of 1806 MHz, and the fact that this card has 150 MHz OC presets that are(mostly) stable is amazing on its own. Overall, a 200+ MHz final overclock over the advertised boost is awesome.Closing Thoughts:This card is very good for its price, so set your expectations accordingly. Since I only purchased one of this card, I do not know whether I just got very lucky to have a very high quality GPU in mine or whether the GPUs in these cards are consistently of a very high quality,so I cannot say whether it will perform like a premium card every time. Regardless, I would recommend installing GPU Tweak II alongside this card and using it to get the max performance out of this card every time."", 'Background: I am a CS student who was taking a neural networking/deep learning class. At the time, I had a GTX 465 with unlocked cores (effectively a 470 just without the name on the GPU). The code I was running was for a convolutional neural network training on an image dataset. Because of this, my computer couldn\'t handle it and I needed to utilize my GPU for calculations via Nvidia CUDA & TensorFlow. Unfortunately, my GTX 465 wasn\'t compatible enough (2.0 compatibility), so I had to upgrade. That\'s when I decided to go for the GTX 1060 because of its compatibility with CUDA (6.0) and its performance capabilities (1080p60 @ max or near max settings for vast majority of games) for such a relatively low cost for a GPU from the newest GeForce line. In other words, it seemed to be exactly what I needed for the class and for general use moving forward after the class.Needless to say, Nvidia has outdone itself with this new line of cards. This card far surpassed my expectations, and it\'s just higher-tier low-tier GPU of the line (""2nd worst"" after the 1050 Ti, not including its 3GB counterpart). Included with the card was a 1-year subscription to XGamecaster and ASUS\' own overclocking software.The CNN training on the Cifar-10 dataset ran 100k iterations with provided TensorFlow code in about an hour (bottlenecked by print statements every 10 iterations). Keep in mind, this card is meant for gaming and not AI-related use (that\'s for the $2000+ Tesla line), which is why I was pleasantly surprised at how fast its computations were.Now onto gaming performance. One thing to note: the overclocking software has three presets: silent mode, gaming mode, and OC mode. Each of these settings allow for the fan to be completely off or on an automatic setting. Its default is gaming. Additionally, you are able to create your own profile and adjust the clock boost, GPU voltage, fan speed, power target, VRAM speed, target temperature, and target FPS.On gaming mode, it was able to run GTA V at near-max settings @ 1080p60 without going over 60 C with the fan on. There was a bit of lag every now and then, which is fair. On OC mode, I am able to do the same thing but with no lag at all. On both settings, the framerate sometimes drops to ~55 and back up again in a split second. it\'s not noticeable to me on my 60hz monitor, but it may be to some.By messing with the settings, I was able to get the clock boost up to 2025 mhz before any real minor or major performance issues. To do this, I set the boost to +85 and the power target/target temperature to 100%/83 C. Then I set the fan speed to 55% and the target FPS to 60 FPS. The boost is able to go past +85 but keep in mind the boost is bottlenecked by how much power the GPU is given (I didn\'t want to mess with the GPU voltage for fear of messing something up).With these settings, I was able to record with Nvidia Shadowplay and maintain 1080p60 with no issues at all. GTA V runs extremely smoothly, maxing out at 63C when heavy rain occurs in the game. Otherwise, it rather ever gets to 55C. Keep in mind, however, that the GPU temp also largely depends on your computer\'s airflow/cooling set up. The fan isn\'t noticeable to me, and I never end up in a room that feels like Texas.The BEST part, however, is the fact that this card is SO efficient, I ended up using less power overall than with my GTX 465. With my GTX 465, I couldn\'t overclock my CPU past 4.2GHz due to power restrictions. With this GTX 1060 card, I was able to overclock the CPU to 4.5GHz. I can possibly overclock it even more, but I\'m fine at 4.5GHz.All in all, I am very satisfied with my purchase. For ~$250, I received a 1080p60-capable card that I can also use for deep learning (to an extent in practicality).For reference, here are my computer specs:i5-2500K @ 4.5GHZMSI P67A-G45 B3 Motherboard8GB RAM @ 1600mhzGTX 1060 6GB250GB Samsung 840 Evo SSD2 TB WD HDD', ""So I thought this during Covid when I built my first pc when things were crazy on sale and everyone was getting ride of inventory. A friend recommended this card to me when it had went on sale. Here it is 3 years later and it's still running like a champ. If your gaming in 1080p. This is it , you can have the settings high get great fps. It has been a champion first graphics card. Running two monitors as well. I wouldn't sleep on this if you're just getting started and you catch it on a sale. Definitely a solid card. Only reason I'm considering upgrading now is because I bought a 1440p ultrawide monitor, so I figured I'd leave this long term review for anyone still considering if this card is still viable. It definitely is awesome first card"", ""I waited a long time to post this review. I wanted to be sure that the performance was there, how the card handles in modern environments, etc.Let me say this card is beautiful. I got it for $271 before tax back in July of 2016. I believe it's closer to $300 now, and it's worth every penny, unless you have the funds to spend more and get a 1070 or 1080.This version of the GTX 1060 comes with 6gb of GDDR5 VRAM and a heavily boosted clock speed. Its only knock is the 192 bit bus instead of 256 bit, but the overall specs of this card more than make up for the bus architecture limitations.My card does rattle sometimes where the HDMI cables are connected, and I'm not sure if it's my particular card, or the card model, or what. I did a search for that problem, and didn't find anything other than complaints about coil whine, which my card does not have. Adjusting the HDMI cables fixes the high pitched rattle (it sounds like coil whine but it's not, sometimes it rattles when I move the case a certain way when cleaning my desk) so it's no big deal.With up to date drivers, I can max games like The Witcher 3 and Doom with this card and an AMD FX-8320 stock clocked. This game has no issues playing anything I throw at it, but games like Forza Horizon 3 I have not tried maxing, in particular Forza because it's a next gen game, and because I've read horror stories of how it performs when you try to set it too high. Saying that, Forza defaults to all near max settings, and looks absolutely stunning for me. Gears of War 4 looks beautiful. FarCry Primal can be played at near max settings.Unless you've got the money and the willpower to get a top of the line 1080, or a really really good 1070 on sale, the 1060 is so much bang for your buck, it's unreal. Keep in mind that the best performance gains you'll see will be on modern systems. If you're still using Windows 7 or 8/8.1, you won't see as much of a difference as you will on a Win 10 system, but you WILL still see a performance increase.Something to think about is that this card is more powerful than the R9 380 it replaced, and uses >maybe< half the power. I went from 2 6-pin connectors on the 380 to 1 6-pin on the 1060. Overall, my cpu runs cooler with the Nvidia 1060 as well, though I suspect that's because the PSU is less taxed (it's just a generic 600w) and not so much from any computations the GPU does.I hope this article helps. 4/5 stars because of the random whining the card makes, otherwise it's a BEAUTIFUL solid card. Before I forget, its max safe operating temp is 95 degrees Celsius. The highest I've ever seen it get is 81 and that was on Witcher 3 with hairworks enabled and everything maxed.Good luck and Have Fun!EDIT 5/14/17: After some more extended use of the card, many testings, a new power supply, etc, I have decided to bump this card up to 5 stars. The whining went away after I replaced one of the HDMI cables with a shorter one. Apparently the weight of the old hdmi cable was weighing on the card and making it uncomfortable... lol. Anyway, as of today, with a stock speed FX 8320, 16gb 1866 DDR3 RAM, and this card, Prey (2017) runs maxed for me at a smooth 60 fps. I know Prey isn't a top taxing game, but still, it is brand new, which shows this card is still very much relevant. Also, since upgrading to a new PSU (power supply) when playing The Witcher 3, the card now only goes up to around 75-76 degrees Celsius max where before it would go up to 78-81 degrees Celsius. Either way there's plenty of headroom as the max safe operating temp is 95 degrees Celsius, but still, I don't like my electronics roasting. If you're looking for a comparable AMD card, the closest offering they have would be the RX 480/580. Honestly, I would still use AMD, but I'm tired of them constantly recycling and rebranding tech. I'm hoping when I'm ready to upgrade this card in 3-5 years, AMD will have advanced to catch up with Nvidia. We'll see."", ""This graphics card is an excellent choice for 1080p gamers! It provides steady frame rates and I can play at 'Ultra' settings in all the titles I play. The GTX 1060 6GB still represents one of the best of the mid-range graphics cards available for the price, and if crypto mining did not inflate the price of the RX 580 GPU's then maybe there would be more equal competition. That being said, my stream of thought was from a full month ago (Sept/2017), and at the time of purchase I paid $364.99 for this 1060 and I admittedly was looking at some RX 580 8GB cards. But they were all around $400-450. So, at the time it did not make sense, but since a month has passed on this purchase there has been some market changes again.While doing some research as I now write this review I am seeing more RX 580's in the price range of $350-400, and admittedly I would recommend the RX 580 in most scenarios over the GTX 1060. Performance wise they are pretty much 100% equal at 1080p gaming, Nvidia cards pull ahead a bit in some titles, while AMD pulls ahead in others, but for the most part they provide identical performance. Software updates have helped the RX 580's performance quite a bit since launch. If you are a new system builder and looking to buy a new monitor etc. the RX 580 is quite compelling, especially for a gaming dedicated build. Free-sync monitors are far cheaper than high refresh rate G-sync monitors, and whereas the RX 580 can be set up in Crossfire the GTX 1060 cannot do SLI.So, seeing my 5/5 star review and reading the last paragraph slamming into the GTX 1060 and praising the RX 580 you may question my 5 star rating. But I will explain why even today I still would have made the same choice I did 1 month ago.1- I already have several systems, all of which have high-end Nvidia graphics cards, but the purpose of this computer was to have a mid-range compact ITX gaming PC, I was not even considering a GTX 1070, 1080, or 1080 Ti. I just wanted steady 70FPS at 1080p 'Ultra' settings. At the time of purchase, this Asus GTX 1060 Dual OC Series 6GB was the best priced full-length graphics card that would fit in my case. The RX 580 I would have considered was at the time over $430, making the 1060 the better price to performance option.2- I already own a 144hz G-sync 1ms response time gaming monitor. So, therefore, ruling out a RX 580 that already cost more money than the 1060.3- And lastly as this system is based on an ITX motherboard, even if SLI was enabled on the GTX 1060 I could only ever put 1 GPU in my system anyways. So, a Crossfire setup had no bearing on my decision. GAMING: Frankly I am tired of reading on tech forums how people don't recommend a GTX 1060 for 1080p gaming. And that to play at 'Ultra' settings you need at least a GTX 1070. That simply is not true. I have a system with a GTX 1080 yet I pretty much exclusively game on my system with a GTX 1060 6GB (paired with an i7-6700k and 16GB of RAM) and I play all my games at 1080p Ultra settings on a my 144hz G-sync monitor, and yet I almost never get lower than 70FPS. Granted some games like Witcher 3 will fall back with Anti-Aliasing at its highest settings but other than maybe dialing that back I know you can leave all other settings at 'Ultra'. I primarily play Battlefront, BF4, BF1, Shadow Of Mordor, GTA V, Watchdogs 2, and Assassins Creed (all of them), at 1080p Ultra settings with no issues what so ever.So, in conclusion, I stand beside my decision to buy this Asus GTX 1060 6GB. It give's me the performance I was expecting out of it and I am very happy with this purchase. I have yet to try and overclock it, but I am interested to see if I can squeeze out some additional performance from this GPU, which is more of a budget GTX 1060.As I said with RX 580 8GB cards finally coming down in price I realize that many of you will be choosing it over a 1060, but if you ignore Crossfire and Free-sync monitors these cards will give you in-game performance so similar that you would never know them from one another. So, I stand by my choice and I encourage you all to choose which makes the most sense for you to buy. I am happy with my decision and although I did not choose this Dual Edition card for its color, it matches my white build perfectly, my decision was made on the price I bought it at. But to those of you considering this graphics card I can highly recommend it!""]",work fine rgb good pay dude deliver gpu literally send neighbour house job dude buy sgd sale boy shock performance

I'm always hesitant when purchasing used electronics, but I can safely say that so far, I do not have any reason to regret this purchase. Not going to lie, I got really nervous when I saw the numerous negative reviews for the seller. I began to worry that if I installed this GPU and it didn't work, I'd be screwed. I contacted the seller to ask about their return policy, and they got back to me within 24 hours. Which was nice because some reviews said they had crappy customer service. Anyway, I purchased a used RTX 3080, it arrived in a box that was kind of dinged up, most likely because the box sat around for a long time, but the product inside was in mint condition, just like the description said. So far I've tested this GPU and I have not had a single problem with it. Of course, I'm still going to pay very close attention over the next month, since the return policy is for 30 days with my purchase, but I really don't anticipate to have any issues. I just wanted to take a minute to write a review, because my experience had been the exact opposite of some of these other people, and I only think it's fair for the the truth that I experienced to be known. Thanks for the awesome GPU at damn near half price, I really appreciate it!"", ""New GPU's are at a very unreasonable price point these days but I was due to upgrade from my GTX1080 after a series of other upgrades earlier this year. Performance in high end games like Cyberpunk and Dying Light 2 on 1440p are very impressive so far. Card runs cool and quiet under a heavy load. Was worried about some of the reviews mentioning coil whine but its non existent for me. If you have the money for it this is a solid choice as far as 3080s go."", ""This graphics card is HUGE, I had to get a bigger case to fit it but it runs and operates great! It does have a small amount of whine under load but I wear headphones and can't hear it.....it makes about the same noise as your cooling fans."", 'I love how easy it was to install and it preforms great. I would definitely recommend buying this graphics card.', ""I primarily use this card for gaming, will most likely see some use for 3D print rendering, but not yet.This card is overkill really for 1080p gaming, but I prefer to have room to grow, with games and different softwares being more and more GPU reliant, I think this will last me the foreseeable future.The fans can get noisy if they're on full speed. With the games I play they have not yet needed to go full speed to maintain a good temperature.With 10GB of VRAM that is very fast, I don't feel like I'm trading off certain graphic settings for others. I was a little leary buying a used component, but this card looked brand new in the box, Amazon did an amazing job making sure this card was worthy of a new owner.I upgraded to this card from a gigabyte rtx2060 that I've been using for almost 4 years, it got the job done, but in the last year I needed more out of a video card.In conclusion, I believe this was a great bang for buck in the 30 series GPU's. With prices coming down finally I suggest picking one up. The software for ASUS called GPU Tweak III is an easy to use and makes it easy to tune the card to get the most reliable performance."", 'Very good card, it works very well...', 'It does not have the operation of a RTX 3080', 'Very solid graphics card', 'I have tested multiple 30 series GPUs. 3080 FE, EVGA 3070 XC3 Ultra, Asus TUF 3070ti, Gigabyte 3080 Auros Master REV 3.0, and now the Asus Rog STRIX 3080 OC V2. Why cant these card manufacturers build a card with no coil whine? The Rog STRIX 3080 would be absolutely perfect without the ""fingers on a chalkboard"" screeching noise of the coil whine that it radiates. The temps are perfect. The fans are completely silent. The aesthetics, looks, and feel are beautiful. It smashes every frame that is thrown at it. Yet, everything is completely tainted with the screeching sound of coil whine. For $1200 it\'s just not acceptable. I want to completely love the Rog Strix 3080, but can\'t because of something that is counter to every modern build, which is noise. Every time I fire up a game I have to die a little because I am reminded that this beautiful piece of machinery is making a horrible grinding noise that cannot be prevented or fixed. AND these company\'s believe that grinding noises are normal and expected so an RMA only allows them to borrow your card for a couple weeks where you will only be sent the same one back stating they found no issues. It\'s horrible and it\'s wrong. I am done ranting. Good luck on being the lucky one who gets a card with no coil whine. From my experience they are a unicorn.', ""Like many I was stuck waiting for graphics cards to come down to a point where they were affordable and not buying from a scalper. This is plenty of card for me with a 5120x1440 display. It's a bit on the noisy side, but that is expected.

The 4070Ti was the best price/performance/power consumption ratio by far, so much so that it was a no brainer for me to settle for it over the 4090. I'm keeping this review shorter than I normally would, since even though I'm an expert at this point I think im just gonna give the main points here and not get overly specific.1)To be competetive in the new AI machine learning world nvidia has a distinct advantage, I'm glad im not struggling with a higher specced AMD card without the damn drivers to give me all the massive speed and efficiency increases that these NVIDIA drivers give me, period. Sry I love AMD too and my chip is nothing other than the meaty and equally mighty Threadripper, but Iove and need are two different things and I need performance and compatibility guaranteed out of anything I pay 800 bucks for.2)Since I'm developing AI based products my mileage will vary from anyone buying this to play a videogame with, all I can say is I wish i had 800 bucks to waste on videogames lol. I'm sure the card is a beast on videogames too but i honestly just wouldn't know, I did a vanity benchmark on some free new TombRaider game that I'll never play and was pleased that the fps was through the roof at highest settings and stopped to reminisce an actually play in some ultrasmooth Borderlands before I got back to work.3)The price :(4)Amazon extended me some credit to buy it over a few payments, so these past four months have been the most productive months in my company's history due to being able to afford this equipment that has been performing solidly and reliably nonstop almost 24/7 since purchase.5)Finally, the 1800 dollar question. Do I regret, after 4 months buying this unit over the 4900? The honest answer is this: Yes, but hell no. Yes, If I had a card twice as fast as this one I wouldn't burst into tears of sadness. But no, I would burst into tears of sadness if it cost me my only remaining kidney what am I supposed to pee with NVIDIA and AMD? Does the 4900 come with a mechanical kidney or at least a promo code towards one instead of FIFA 2026? If so then ok I wish I would've bought the 4900 even thought it would have cost twice the power to use 24/7, so my power company will be twice as happy. I honestly dont know, if I have more customers then the 4090 may become a necessity, but I'm not looking forward to it.6)There u have it, I hope even though it only covered the basics, like yes if you get it for machine learning you will be very glad you did and have a card that is more than capable of cranking out professional production level product with efficiency, speed, power savings, economical, plug and play compatibility with every thing type of performance. you're welcome. Would not recommend to my competition."", ""I had the graph GTX 1080Ti, and it was time to update the graph and after seeing several reviews on which Card Buy and make comparisons between several models 3080Ti, 4060Ti, 4070Ti and 4080Ti, my conclusion and decision was the 4070Ti TUF, what you consider was Bus, Mhz, Price, Performance in 4k, DLSS, AI, CUstrunos, durability in 4k. In video games, his performance is great and hardly heated that it is also great. But the final verdict as soon as performance will be with the Starfield game (which still doesn't come out) and StarWars Outlaws. Now I am playing Kena The Bridge of Spirits and If there is a big big difference when playing with the 1080Ti.If the interested party has the money to buy it, no doubt. Highly recommended.And of course, if you have gaming hardware (motherboard, memory, processor, SSD), you better not buy it."", ""I buy it when I was on sale so with the dolar drop and the discount I got out in just over 15k MXN. It's large and you need a somewhat larger cabinet from the community to burn, but fortunately not as much as to need a huge cabinet. It comes with a support although I put a ROG HERCULX. So far everything goes well, I play at 1080p so the graph has not been heated further than the 70C even in long play sessions with the graphs in Ultra, but this GPU is made for 1440, I still do not update my monitor but as soon as I do it is updating my resena."", 'Amazon was having a sale on these. And they also offered a payment plan. Win-Win.My 1080Ti was looking to retire and I wasn\'t wanting to wait around until Gen 5 gets launched.The 4070 was a good compromise on power and performance for the money. The -80 series and -90 series are great if you are a member of the trust fund club, and the -60 series seem to be underperforming for their price point.The added bonus is that the rest of my setup is TUF.

‎B096YPLGHG,"ASUS TUF Gaming NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti OC Edition Graphics Card (PCIe 4.0, 8GB GDDR6X, HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4a, Dual Ball Fan Bearings, Military-Grade Certification, GPU Tweak II)",Graphics Cards,"S$1,060.00",https://www.amazon.sg/ASUS-Graphics-DisplayPort-Military-Grade-Certification/dp/B096YPLGHG/ref=sr_1_42?qid=1695856982&refinements=p_36%3A5000-500000%2Cp_72%3A6469119051%2Cp_n_prime_domestic%3A7993547051%7C7993548051&rnid=7993546051&s=computers&sr=1-42,4.7,"['good', ""As a 3D artist, the graphics card you choose can significantly impact your workflow and the quality of your work. I recently made the ASUS TUF Gaming NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti the centerpiece of my workstation, and it has truly been a game-changer in the world of 3D rendering and content creation. Here's why I believe the ASUS TUF RTX 3070 Ti deserves an outstanding review from a 3D artist's perspective.1. Unparalleled Rendering Speed:The ASUS TUF RTX 3070 Ti harnesses the power of NVIDIA's Ampere architecture and 8GB of GDDR6X video memory, delivering lightning-fast rendering speeds. Complex 3D scenes that used to take hours to render are now completed in a fraction of the time. This card significantly boosts productivity and allows me to tackle more ambitious projects.2. Ray Tracing and DLSS:Ray tracing capabilities in the RTX 3070 Ti elevate the realism of 3D scenes by accurately simulating light interactions. The inclusion of DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) not only enhances performance but also improves the overall image quality. It's a game-changer when it comes to creating lifelike visuals.3. Quiet and Efficient Cooling:As a 3D artist, my work often involves long rendering sessions that put a heavy load on the GPU. The ASUS TUF's robust cooling solution, with its triple fans and Axial-tech design, keeps temperatures in check while remaining impressively quiet. I can work for extended periods without worrying about overheating or noise distractions.4. Durability and Reliability:The TUF Gaming brand is known for its durability, and this card is no exception. The use of military-grade components and a reinforced backplate ensures that it can handle the demands of 3D rendering and content creation without breaking a sweat. This reliability is crucial for professionals who rely on their hardware day in and day out.5. Future-Proofed Connectivity:The RTX 3070 Ti supports PCIe 4.0, making it ready for future advancements in GPU technology. It also features HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4a, making it suitable for high-resolution displays and multi-monitor setups - a must for 3D artists who demand precise detail and accuracy in their work.6. User-Friendly Software:ASUS' GPU Tweak II software allows for easy overclocking and monitoring, ensuring that the GPU is performing optimally for rendering tasks. It provides real-time information about GPU utilization, temperature, and clock speeds, helping me fine-tune my workflow.In conclusion, the ASUS TUF Gaming NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti is an absolute gem for 3D artists and content creators. Its exceptional rendering speed, ray tracing capabilities, efficient cooling, durability, and future-proofed connectivity make it the ideal choice for professionals who demand the best in GPU performance. While it may come at a premium price, the productivity gains and improved quality of work are well worth the investment. The ASUS TUF RTX 3070 Ti has earned its place as a crucial tool in my 3D artist's toolkit, and I highly recommend it to anyone in the creative field looking to elevate their work to new heights."", ""I like it. It's quiet can't really hear it. It brings good fps to the games"", 'Brand new, the packaging flawless in terms of no bruising or damage while in transit. Easy installation, but will have to invest in a 240mm AIO radiator in the near future to keep noise levels and potential hot temperatures down (regardless how much I love the look of the stock radiator and the TUF logo lighting up). It has tiny switch that can toggle for ""Performance"" or ""Quietness"".As far as games go; my personal targeted games:Halo Infinite - I really wanted to spoil Halo Infinite\'s open ring world and cut scenes being able to game at 1440p Ultra Settings which I found this card is more than perfect for (70fps min in really tense situations - high 90fps for lesser dense areas).Cyberpunk 2077 - This card targeted everything on Ultra for 1440p and it was struggle for the most part. I had to go in and tune down the Ray Tracing and turn off the Motion Blur. It\'s hard to say concretely what settings makes this game playable with smooth FPS, so I\'ll leave this for TBD.Red Dead Redemption 2 - This card maxed out everything and it runs beautifully on 1440p (best to have 32GB of RAM to reduce the stutter and freezing moments, my personal opinion)For now, this card is right for me and I\'m glad I scored it when I did and I\'m very satisfied!', ""Title says it all. It's a heavy old gal, but your case should be able to support it. If desired, there are GPU holders for these big cards.For those who aren't as technically aware (like me), this thing won't simply be powered by the PCI slot it goes into. It takes a dedicated connection to your power supply. But that's good; this thing has a lot of power behind it, able to run flight simulators with ease. Those programs are very GPU intensive, and I get no less than 44 FPS in X-Plane 12 on high settings.When I say this thing's quiet, I mean I never hear it. I actually had to check to make sure the fans were running, but when I'm on X-Plane, they're spinning away in there.The RGB lighting is a nice touch. Overall, 10/10."", ""Upgrading from a 1660 this thing is a huge improvement, I just wish it had more memory.A slight annoyance I came across is that the HDMI ports are the 'last' ports on the card. My main monitor doesn't support Displayport so I ended up having to get another HDMI cable to put my second monitor in the second HDMI port to get it to come up as monitor 2 in windows."", 'The 3070ti is an amazing upgrade from my 1070. I can crank the settings, with the resolution set to 1440p, and get about 90-100 fps depending on the game, such as Tiny Tina and Horizon Zero Dawn.Only downside is I paid for a NEW card but when I received it, I noticed the seal was not even sticky anymore and the corners of the box are a bit torn as if someone had a hard time putting the box back in the outer cover box. Seems like I have received an open box item. The plastic tape around the card is still on the card but that doesnt mean anything since the fans can still move air and the card can run with it still applied. I just hope this card was not heavily used.I did read a review from another customer that was in this same situation. I would have given it a 5 star rating were it not for this issue.', ""honestly, I'm impressed. I have a horrible airflow & yet the thermals are not exceeding 70 underloads."", ""I built a new computer last year, but I couldn't/wouldn't pay the price for a new GPU at the time, so I temporarily kept my 1660ti. Now that I got a 3070ti for about $30 (Canadian) over MSRP, I gave in. I only play MSFS 2020 and a bunch of driving simulators, all in VR. The 3070ti is a great step up from the 1660ti. I figured I would wait for the 4000 series, but I probably made a mistake and only got a 750 watt power supply, and from what I hear, I probably could only get a 4060 when they come out, because 4000 series are supposed to be very power hungry. Who knows what the availability/pricing will be for a 4060, and I didn't want to wait another ~ year for similar card.I am very happy with the card, and VR is great :-)"", ""Got it for $35 above the MSRP, but it's still a great deal compared to the insane prices we were asked to pay since the 3xxx series release and up to a week ago. High quality card with the decent cooling system and reliable components. No coil whine, the card is very quiet when running games, temperatures are even better/lower, than what I was expecting for the Ti card. I'm really happy with this product, as it was only 3% more expensive than a regular 3070 version, bur at the same time it's running 5% - 7% faster.""]",good artist graphic card choose significantly impact workflow quality work recently asus tuf gaming nvidia geforce rtx ti centerpiece workstation truly gamechanger world rendering content creation believe asus tuf rtx ti deserve outstanding review artist perspective unparalleled rendering speedthe asus tuf rtx ti harness power nvidias ampere architecture gb gddrx video memory deliver lightningfast render speeds complex scene use hour render complete fraction time card significantly boost productivity allow tackle ambitious projects ray tracing dlssray trace capability rtx ti elevate realism scene accurately simulate light interaction inclusion dlss deep learning super sampling enhance performance improve overall image quality gamechanger come create lifelike visuals quiet efficient coolingas artist work involve long render session heavy load gpu asus tuf robust cool solution triple fan axialtech design temperature check remain impressively quiet work extended period worry overheat noise distractions durability reliabilitythe tuf gaming brand know durability card exception use militarygrade component reinforce backplate ensure handle demand rendering content creation break sweat reliability crucial professional rely hardware day day futureproofed connectivitythe rtx ti support pcie ready future advancement gpu technology feature hdmi displayport suitable highresolution display multimonitor setup artist demand precise detail accuracy work userfriendly softwareasus gpu tweak ii software allow easy overclocking monitoring ensure gpu perform optimally render task provide realtime information gpu utilization temperature clock speed help finetune workflowin conclusion asus tuf gaming nvidia geforce rtx ti absolute gem artist content creator exceptional render speed ray trace capability efficient cool durability futureproofe connectivity ideal choice professional demand good gpu performance come premium price productivity gain improve quality work worth investment asus tuf rtx ti earn place crucial tool artist toolkit highly recommend creative field look elevate work new height like quiet hear bring good fps game brand new packaging flawless term bruising damage transit easy installation invest mm aio radiator near future noise level potential hot temperature regardless love look stock radiator tuf logo light tiny switch toggle performance quietnessas far game personal target gameshalo infinite want spoil halo infinites open ring world cut scene able game ultra settings find card perfect fps min tense situation high fps dense areascyberpunk card target ultra struggle tune ray tracing turn motion blur hard concretely setting game playable smooth fps leave tbdred dead redemption card maxe run beautifully good gb ram reduce stutter freeze moment personal opinionfor card right glad score satisfied title heavy old gal case able support desire gpu holder big cardsfor technically aware like thing simply power pci slot dedicated connection power supply good thing lot power able run flight simulator ease program gpu intensive fps xplane high settingswhen thing quiet mean hear actually check sure fan run xplane spin away therethe rgb lighting nice touch overall upgrading thing huge improvement wish memorya slight annoyance come hdmi port port card main monitor support displayport end hdmi cable second monitor second hdmi port come monitor window ti amazing upgrade crank setting resolution set fps depend game tiny tina horizon zero dawnonly downside pay new card receive notice seal sticky anymore corner box bit torn hard time box outer cover box like receive open box item plastic tape card card mean fan air card run apply hope card heavily usedi read review customer situation star rating issue honestly impressed horrible airflow thermal exceed underload build new computer year notwould pay price new gpu time temporarily ti ti canadian msrp play msfs bunch drive simulator vr ti great step ti figure wait series probably mistake watt power supply hear probably come serie suppose power hungry know availabilitypricing want wait year similar cardi happy card vr great got msrp great deal compare insane price ask pay xxx series release week ago high quality card decent cool system reliable component coil whine card quiet running game temperature betterlow expect ti card happy product expensive regular version bur time run fast ,"ASUS TUF Gaming NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti is an absolute gem for 3D artists and content creators.

Box was sealed and honestly great performance for the platform of gamers it aims for it's a great card!Tiny form factor! I just upgraded from a EVGA 1060gb 6gb single fan and it's roughly the same size as the older model! The cooler on it is massive! The Asus phoenix generally takes 3 slots while the evga would only take two slots.Specs: It's roughly in the same ball park as a 1080ti and a 2070 super. You can game on a 1080p monitor and get 60-80fps ultra settings but I've seen it also get 50-70fps on a 1440p I just think it's the drivers or Ampere technology making it utilize so well in 2k. In my opinion the 3060 can get 70fps average on 1080p and 60 fps average on 2k, 4k however it struggles with medium/high settings only getting 20-50fps.Thermals are great! My GTX 1060 6gb was hitting 90c while this one runs around 60-80c it's also quieter too! Both GPUs use the same 100% utilization when gaming at similar specs.Overall: It's a great mid tier card! If you plan on gaming with high refresh rate of 144hz on 1080p your definitely getting 80fps average!At 1440p you can definitely game at 60fps average! At 4K it's playable if you are okay with 30-50fps average.Personally: I'm having buyers remorse, I wish I went with the 3060ti because the 27% increase in performance would definitely please my 60 fps needs at 3k gaming! Im running at 3960x1080p resolution triple monitor and my fps is averaging 40-50fps which is expected because at 4K i would be getting the same fps. I might be limited by my cpu and pcie 3.0 so I might get better results if I upgrade my mobo and cpu more testing needs to be done, but in my opinion the 3060 ti would definitely get me the 60 fps I need except in GTA V it runs 60fps solid, but that's because the game runs better on triple monitors.Cons: What's the point of 12gb vram? Ampere is great but the GPU is actually the same as a 3060 6gb laptop variant. I get the same fps I would on my laptop with both systems getting average 70fps on 1080p ultra gaming.It's odd but when utilizing 3.5gigs of vram I can maintain 70fps+ on high settings but if you go into 5 gig or 6 gig territory the card really struggles, it's like only 4 gigs of vram is actually been properly utilized and the extra 8 is just crap in comparison. Maybe it's the 192-bit bus because I've only seen it utilize 4gigs properly.Personally it's a great 1080p card if you want 144fps 1440p card for 60fps but it will struggle in 4K gaming.If you want high refresh rates I would definitely go with 3060 ti and above because I feel like this card can only perform at best 75fps 1080p ultra settings with low raytracing from what I've seen.The only game I've seen it get 240fps is League of Legends.My 1060 6gb was only getting max 140fps so it's definitely an upgrade but I'm not really seeing a difference on my 144hz monitorIs this a card I'm planning on using for a while? No with todays age and 2k gaming and 4K being widespread you can use a small 2k monitor and average 60fps but With 4K 144hz is almost around the corner so I see myself upgrading in the near future very soon.Sadly I can't return it because it's a GPU things are hard to get and I enjoy 1080p ultra setting gaming at 70fps. But is 600$ worth it? Nah I would rather get a 3060ti because you would definitely get 120+ fps at 1080p on ultra.If I sold my 1060 at 250$ msrp i would definitely gotten the 3060 at 350 msrp maybe scalpers are trying to make us give away our old gpus to everyone haha!I do enjoy how my 3060 laptop and my 3060pc give the same performance in all the games! Ampere is definitely ahead of its time when it comes to utilization!"", '', 'Does what I expected it to do.

On the lowest tuning settings that will run stable the 3060 still has noticeable sound compatible to murmurs when running a moderately challenging game like warzone but something that leans on the GPU more like Warframe will have the card whirring up to about the sound of a space heater/conversation but not quite ear destroying levels like a hairdryer. Coming from a dead silent card I was annoyed that you can't lower the fan speed below 30% using driver settings or the asus tuning app. I don't like having to rely on MSI Afterburner but it is the only way to quiet the fan lower then being at a constant whisper. Graphically it works as you'd expect from watching any youtube video comparison so really the only thing to consider is if the card runs hot (nope) or if the card is the right size for you case (nearly as small as the pci slot) and if the sound levels are tolerable (quiet enough if you're patient). If you can live with 30% fan sound background noise or don't mind the risks of setting your own afterburner settings then it's a solid buy.

This laptop does have a backlit keyboard which is nice when working in a darker environment. Initial setup resulted in a blue screen before it even went to the home screen for the first time, which corrupted everything. restarting from the blue screen let everything load eventually but noticed everything running sluggish and slow. It then had two windows updates that would fail installation that I could not remedy. I ended up wiping all partitions including the recovery partitions and loaded windows 10 from scratch, which took way less time than fighting the update problems the night before. With a completely clean install, this computer runs exactly as it should. The only thing that did not return from my clean install was MacAfee antivirus which I don't use anyway. Boot up times are less than 30 seconds, the fingerprint reader works flawlessly. The stylus pen works good, the magnetic sleeve holder for the stylus is a nice touch. It comes with 8 gigs of ddr4 3200 memory, 4 gigabytes are soldered in and 4 gigabytes via memory module that is upgradable. I have not upgraded the memory yet but eventually will as needed.

In addition, the computer itself through MyAsus has a battery protection mode that limits its load to 80% of its ability to protect it and lasts longer, however remembers not to leave it connected for a long time. It is relatively light, easy to transport and feels premium, the body is mostly plastic but it seems that the screen has an aluminium body, which gives it good appearance. The performance is good, allows me good multitasking without bugs. I still don\'t try it for games but I\'ll update when I have time to try them. As for tablet and touch mode, gestures work well, but sometimes touch may fail a bit, as it is not recognized or recognized spontaneously without touch, however I have realized that this only happens on YouTube full screen. In addition, there are websites and some applications that are not well optimized for touch. Yeah. the NFL page does not support tactile entry, or Adobe that if accepted tactile entry but feels poorly optimized and unfluid. As for Office programs the touch works completely normal, just like on YouTube (except for the previous comment), Crunchyroll, Netflix, Star, Dinsey+, but sometimes you can feel a bit the lack of optimization. It has a backlit keyboard and the mouse tactil panel has a button to activate a very useful numeric keyboard. Unlocking with print is not the big thing, try to configure my print but the reader does not work very properly, unlocking it conventionally, is faster. The level of brightness is not the great thing but it looks very well in interiors, not so, the reflections increase with environmental illumination and clear in exterior. So the screen looks great and I\'ve already been shot. I haven\'t changed anything yet, but it seems to have an extra slot for RAM. The camera has physical blockage. It comes with foreign keyboard, does not have N but you can configure the keyboard to LATAM, only the keys will not correspond with the special characters (not letters), although it can be annoying tantito is only getting used to. The body looks a little thicker than I expected, but it\'s still thin and looks elegant. The hinges feel firm and resilient and allow several angles.The bad, the horns are not so good despite being Hardman Kardon, at first they were heard well and did not give them excessive use, but when they used them if they did it with the volume somewhat high, so beware of it because two weeks enough for the horns to ""revent"" and now if they are heard but with some statica. EDIT It seems that the problem of horns had to do with the BIOS, so that the system works well the BIOS must be properly updated. That\'s how I did it, and after the upgrade the horns went back to normal, if they listen very well but nothing extraordinary. However, departing from this experience I have learned that the laptop does not have the way to make the guarantee valid because it is the product of U.S.A and the policies of the Asus in Mexico with cover guarantees of products that have not been exported by Asus Mexico. So my laptop works normal and is excellent for daily multimedia use and productivity, but has no guarantee backing. If there were any other bad looks about these laptops, I would mention having to clean the screen often because I love to use the touch. In general an excellent purchase, I do not regret but probably acquire insurance for the same would not be a bad idea in case of accidents.', 'so ive waited a good while to write this review. I absolutely hunt and grind when im looking for a product to buy and i will look at every single aspect of a device before i make a decision.1. screen quality:the screen is relatively bright and indoors i have no real issues with glare. the resolution is high enough that i dont feel a need for more. no dead pixels but i will say color is NOT a strong point for this laptop. im not a content creator and even i feel the transition from my desktop to this laptop jarring when it comes to colors. the default wallpaper makes it look god but even on the vivid preset, it is quite washed out. nout a deal breaker but not color accurate by any means.2. Battery life:so i havnt reach the full extent of the battery because i immediatly enabled the battery life saver that stops charging at 80% and i consider 30% to be dead so right away i lose 50% of max battery and still i get about 3 and a half hours with typical school use which is browser tabs with max brightness so pretty solid. it charges quickly with the included 90 watt charger and even my aftermarket 65 watt charger charges it form 30 to 80% in 1 hours while using it.3. Performance:Performance has been great so far. i havnt pushed it to its absolute max but it can handle light gaming and even modern games if you crank the settings down. the heat that comes out on heavy use is intense but under light use the fan doesnt even kick on so it stays cool and silent in most use cases.4. keyboard:Keyboard is good enough for what it is. this entire review was typed on the laptop without too many issues. the backlight is busted by default, there is a setting in the included asus software that fixes the backlight not changing with the function key. under customization, input device settings set function key lock to normal function key uses and it will work as expected.5. Upgrades:so far i have upgrades the ram to 24gb with a single 16gb stick and a swapped the included wifi card with an intel one and that helped with the slow connection to wifi on startup. the would be about a 30 second delay after boot where there would be no internet. the ssd can be swapped with a larger 2210 but the 512gb is enough for me and its plenty fast. very easy to open and clean.conclusion:i absolutely love this laptop. ive never owned a relatively modern laptop and this is an amazing first start. i hope it holds up for many years to come', ""I've never had this advanced of a computer before- the last Windows I had was a Windows 7, so this is by far an upgrade.The only reason I purchased this was for my college classes that required a system that supported Adobe Illustrator and InDesign. Good thing is, this computer does.The first problem I encountered with this was the UPDATES. There was so many, it just STOPPED UPDATING. I troubledshooted about ten times before I made the decision to reinstall Windows 11 by resetting it. It kept all my information and updated everything that it needed to. Since then, it runs well, and is out of my league of tech intelligence. The touch screen is so convient, the finger print is instant, and the key pad is nice. As a previous Chromebook user, it is much more touchy and is an adjustment for sure.The fan is loud when it is opening large apps and is running a certain amount of things at a time, so don't be surprised by that. The flip and hinges are much more stable than I expected. It was the first thing I tested and it was definitely sturdy. I am no expert, but the audio is alright. I have not tested the Bluetooth, but I do know the audio from it seems muffled. Then again, that might just be me not being used to the advancements.THE BATTERY--- is questionable. After an hour and a half I sit at almost 55%. That to me is concerning. I have a Chromebook that will sit at 89/90% after that long. Long lasting might be a bit of an overstatement. However-, if it is in sleep, it keeps a good charge. Running anything for a period of time seems to be a killer.So far it is doing what it needs to do, and is nice. For the price, I wouldn't say it's reasonable. I know tech has issues, but the hours-long fight I had with this thing was ridiculous and not worth almost $700. But, for being on the cheaper side for something of its nature, it's good for it's use.SIDE NOTE: I highly recommend anyone switching from chrome or anything that isn't Microsoft to get a Microsoft account before purchasing. Yes, basic knowledge, but having that all set before having the product will be much easier. I luckily was able to use my old account from when I had my Windows 7."", ""There aren't many reviews online for the Vivobook S14 Non-OLED version so I may even make a video review of it.While this is not an OLED screen, it looks fantastic. Probably better than all other IPS displays I ever saw.The touchscreen works great.You CAN charge it on the USB-C port, even with a weak 5V output phone charger. In that case charging is slow, so it's best when charged with the closed lid in the sleep mode. I use a 20V, 33W USB-C charger and it works great. But, the stock ASUS 90W charger of course charges it the fastest.The Ryzen 5600H is blazing fast, at least for my work. I haven't tried any graphically intensive tasks yet.I haven't installed more RAM for now.The keyboard is fantastic. I write a lot in my work, and it feels great. The muffled keystroke sound coupled with some kind of unique matt coating makes the keyboard one of the best I ever used.The sound quality is pretty good for a laptop. My other laptops can't compare.The camera has a shutter, a nice feature.The hinges look like they will last a long time.The laptop is light and easy to carry with you.Above all, the aesthetics of it are phenomenal. Easily the most beautiful laptop I ever had. I hope it'll serve me well for a long time."", 'It is a very good and fast laptop, I really like the screen that is Touch and can be used as Tablet. The processor is good, ram memory is little but can expand, generally very good purchase!', ""For the cost, this PC is excellent. 8 GB of RAM is absolutely adequate for school work, basic home things, web browsing, and other moderate tasks. This PC's processor is decent and helps complement the mid-range amount of RAM so you don't have hangups.I mainly use it for web browsing, file handling, and things for military work since I need to be able to use a USB card reader with a Windows computer.If you plan on finding a computer for gaming, do not get this computer.
